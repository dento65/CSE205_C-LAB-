// The memory is divided into stack,heap and where the program runs.
// In recursion we repeatedly call the func until the base case condition is met.
// Given that func runs again and again this is similar to looping.

// Stack(memory) is used in case of recursion as it temporarily helps in keeping track of things
// till the function ends/stops after that the memory consumed is freed.

// A recursive func can be used as an alternative to loops but loops are preferred mostly as 
// recursive func are costly in terms of memory and can lead to stack overflow and areslower
// in contrast to loops.

// But when we have a mathemetical func in that case recusrsion is preffered over loops.

// Generally if else is the control statement that we find in recursive functions.
